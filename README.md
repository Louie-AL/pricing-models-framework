**Pricing Models & Forecasting Framework**

This repository contains a collection of pricing models, forecasting tools, and data analysis methods designed for financial applications. It includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for modeling, visualization, and inverse computations. The project leverages structured data to analyze revenue trends, deal structures, and financial multipliers.

*Features*

📈 Pricing Models: Implementations of financial pricing techniques in pricing_models.py.
🔮 Forecasting Models: Predictive analytics for financial data in forecast_models.py.
📊 Data Analysis & Visualization: Jupyter notebooks for bucket analysis, rate tables, and multipliers.
🏦 Financial Datasets: Historical deal and revenue data for modeling and validation.
📜 Documentation & Licensing: A README.md for setup instructions and a LICENSE for terms of use.
